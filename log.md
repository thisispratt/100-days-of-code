# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Revised the HTML/HTML5 section and a couple of exercises for Basic CSS of the Responsive Web design Certification on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Revisited the HTML/HTML5 section on freecodecamp and practiced it.(This was quick)

### Day 2: December 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Zapped past the basic CSS section of the Freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** 
NOTE:
1. Fonts on a webpage can be made super responsive using relative units.
   For ex: Use a relative unit to size the parent font/heading acc. to the viewport and then again use the relative unit (like em) to      size the child font.
2. Don't forget about css variables and  media queries (They are really helpful in developing responsive websites).  
   @media(max-width: 200px){ list of properties...}

### Day 3: December 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on the Applied Visual Design Section of FreeCodeCamp. Revised the positioning concept.
The animation part is still left, will complete it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**  Revision is taking a lot of time.. I should speed up the process.

### Day 4: December 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Completed the Applied Visual Design of FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Animations are so interesting, but I tend to forget them so easily.
              I think I should start incorporating animations on the webpages I create, this way I would retain the concepts of                       animation.

### Day 5: December 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Applied accessibility section at Freecodecamp completed.

**Thoughts:**  HTML5 has so many new elements which are useful for screen readers.I should use them.


### Day 6: December 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Done with the Responsive web design priniciples and CSS Flexbox at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**  Need to complete the FCC's projects ASAP.
