# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Revised the HTML/HTML5 section and a couple of exercises for Basic CSS of the Responsive Web design Certification on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Revisited the HTML/HTML5 section on freecodecamp and practiced it.(This was quick)

### Day 2: December 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Zapped past the basic CSS section of the Freecodecamp.

**Thoughts:** 
NOTE:
1. Fonts on a webpage can be made super responsive using relative units.
   For ex: Use a relative unit to size the parent font/heading acc. to the viewport and then again use the relative unit (like em) to      size the child font.
2. Don't forget about css variables and  media queries (They are really helpful in developing responsive websites).  
   @media(max-width: 200px){ list of properties...}

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
